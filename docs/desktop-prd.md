# Desktop app (M6): draft PRD

Status: draft for the principal to correct. Once approved, its requirements move into `PRD.md`
under milestone M6, and this file is removed.

## 1. Problem

Today ANOMANDER is a daemon the principal starts by hand or with Docker, configured through
`.env`, and reached only through Telegram. The principal wants it as a desktop app, as
gentle-dot does (`docs/stack.md`): open the app and ANOMANDER is running, talk to it there,
and keep its secrets in the operating system instead of a text file.

## 2. Goals

- DK-G1. Opening the app starts ANOMANDER; quitting it stops ANOMANDER.
- DK-G2. Talk to ANOMANDER in the app, with the same rules and answers as in Telegram.
- DK-G3. Secrets live in the macOS Keychain, never in a file.
- DK-G4. Keep the daemon's guarantees: one ledger, the authority check in code (§8.1), no
  public port.

## 3. Non-goals (v1)

- Voice and computer control (gentle-dot's `voice` and `computer` modules). Later matters.
- Windows and Linux. v1 is macOS, where the Keychain and the menu bar live (assumption).
- Automatic updates, code signing and notarization. v1 is built and installed by the principal
  (assumption).
- Running ANOMANDER while the app is closed. That is what Docker is for (decision 2).

## 4. Principles it must keep

- **One daemon.** The app starts the same daemon Docker runs, with its Telegram front door. It
  never runs a second copy of the engine.
- **The app is a front door, not a second brain.** Rules, wording and writes stay in the
  daemon; the app sends what the principal types and shows what the daemon answers.
- **Rust where the operating system is touched** (`docs/stack.md`): starting the daemon, the
  Keychain, the menu bar. TypeScript everywhere else.
- **No public port.** The channel between the app and the daemon is local only.

## 5. Requirements (draft)

- DK-1 Supervision.
  - AC1: opening the app starts the daemon; quitting the app stops it, and no daemon process is
    left running.
  - AC2: if the daemon exits on its own, the app starts it again. After 3 exits within 5
    minutes it stops trying and shows the daemon as stopped, with the last error line and no
    secret in it.
- DK-2 A single daemon.
  - AC1: when a daemon is already running on the same database, a second one refuses to start
    and says so; the ledger is unchanged.
  - AC2: when Telegram answers `409 Conflict` (another process, such as a Docker install, reads
    the same bot), the app shows that another ANOMANDER is using the bot.
- DK-3 Local channel.
  - AC1: the daemon listens on `127.0.0.1` only, on a WebSocket whose message types live in
    `packages/protocol`.
  - AC2: every connection must present a token the app generates at each launch and hands to
    the daemon without writing it to disk; any other connection is closed with no data.
- DK-4 Chat.
  - AC1: a text typed in the app goes through the same path as a Telegram text, and its answer
    is the same string: "23 € cena" creates the same expense and the same S-1 reply.
  - AC2: an image dropped in the app is a receipt, as a photo in Telegram (R-3).
  - AC3: a question with buttons (Sí/No and the like) shows its buttons; pressing one is the
    same answer as in Telegram. A decision answered in one channel is closed in both, and a
    press on the other gets S-19.
  - AC4: the conversation is one: turns from Telegram and from the app are the same recent
    context (R-16 AC3).
  - AC5: what ANOMANDER sends unasked (reminders, the morning digest, the weekly summary) goes
    to Telegram only, as today, whether or not the app's chat is open (decision 4).
- DK-5 Secrets in the Keychain.
  - AC1: the Telegram bot token, the provider API keys and the subscription login are stored
    in the macOS Keychain, entered once in the app's setup screen.
  - AC2: the app hands them to the daemon when it starts it, as the child process's
    environment; they are never written to a file and never logged.
  - AC3: `.env` keeps working for Docker installs; the app does not read it.
- DK-6 Menu bar.
  - AC1: an icon shows whether ANOMANDER is running, stopped or failing.
  - AC2: its menu opens the chat, starts or stops ANOMANDER, and quits.
- DK-7 While the app is closed.
  - AC1: nothing runs. At launch, what was missed follows the rules already in force: a late
    reminder gets S-43 (R-25 AC7), and the morning digest is sent if it is still before 12:00
    (R-26 AC6).
  - AC2: a weekly summary missed while the app was closed is not sent later (decision 5).
- DK-8 Data.
  - AC1: the database and the images live in the app's data folder
    (`~/Library/Application Support/ANOMANDER`), folder `700`, files `600`, as in §16.

## 6. Decisions

1. **Where the daemon runs.** Decided (2026-11-10): on the principal's machine, started by the
   app, and only while the app is open.
2. **One daemon.** Decided (2026-11-10): the app and Docker are two ways to run the same
   daemon. One or the other, never both at once (DK-2).
3. **Chat in v1.** Decided (2026-11-10): yes, besides control (start, stop, status, secrets).
4. **Where unasked messages go.** Decided (2026-11-10): to Telegram only (DK-4 AC5).
5. **A missed weekly summary.** Decided (2026-11-10): it stays missed, as today (R-10): if the
   app is closed on Sunday at the summary's time, that week has none (DK-7 AC2).
6. **The app's interface.** Assumption: React with Vite inside Tauri's window, as gentle-dot's
   `packages/ui`.

## 7. Milestone

M6 Desktop, in slices: first the app that starts and supervises the daemon, with the menu bar
and the Keychain (DK-1, DK-2, DK-5 to DK-8); then the local channel and the chat (DK-3, DK-4).
It does not depend on M5b.
